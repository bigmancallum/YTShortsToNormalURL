# YTShortsToNormalURL

## What is this?
This small program converent a YouTube Shorts URL (i.e. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jiiwJx2QW-E) into a regular YouTube URL (i.e. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiiwJx2QW-E).

## Why is that helpful?
The Shorts interface is annoying. You can't scrub through the video and view specific parts, the description button is almost invisible, and the video loops over and over again. With a regular YouTube URL, you can view a YouTube Shorts as if it was just a regular (albeit portrait and short) YouTube video.
